#Code Reviews

A repository intended to help learners practice code review skills, the command line, and the GitHub workflow.

How to use:

1. Clone this repository to your computer using the command line.

2. Review the code. This could mean several things:

* Simply read the code and inspect it visually
* If it's code that can be displayed via the browser (HTML/CSS/etc), load it on your local machine and inspect it that way.

3\. See some code that needs to be changed? Submit your change/review as a pull request (PR). PRs can be submitted via the GitHub website.

The [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](GitHub workflow) will be critical in helping you. It will come in handy when you reach Step 3 above.
